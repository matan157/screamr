# Screamr

In my adventures of learning hardware through the Raspberry Pi Zero, I put together something to annoy my parents. This project used a PIR Motion sensorto detect movement, and then plays an annoying sound.

## Installation and Usage

Well, all you have to do is download it, and run it with ``python3 screamr.py``. It will detect motion and handle the rest.

*I recommend setting the pi up where you want it and using SSH to run the script*

**For those with RPi Zero, you need to either:**
    1) Solder in a 3.5mm audio output jack onto the RPiZero.
    2) Use a mini-HDMI to VGA convertor, and using the audio out on the convertor.
